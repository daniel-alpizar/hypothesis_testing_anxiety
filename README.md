# Gender and Academic Year Impact on Student Anxiety Levels during COVID-19

## Overview
This project investigates the impact of gender and academic year on moderate to severe anxiety levels among Canadian undergraduate students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing data from a survey conducted between September and October 2020, we aim to understand how these factors contribute to anxiety levels in this population.

## Objectives
- To explore differences in anxiety levels between male and female students.
- To examine the relationship between academic year and anxiety levels among female students.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a publicly available dataset collected by Patterson and Reeves (2022), comprising responses from students enrolled in full-time undergraduate programs at Canadian universities. The final analysis includes 1,169 respondents after data cleaning.

## Methods
The project employs statistical analysis techniques, including chi-square tests and proportion tests, to investigate the dataset. Data cleaning and preparation focus on anxiety scores from the DASS-21 questionnaire.

## Key Findings
- Female students experience higher levels of moderate to severe anxiety compared to male students.
- No significant relationship was found between the academic year and moderate to severe anxiety levels among female students.
